# TODOs

- [ ] Review what was done last time (because then @goloroden was coding alone)
- [ ] Rename `NoteDescription` and `ControllerDescription` to `Note` and `Controller` (or something like that)
- [ ] Do the same for the `create...` functions
- [ ] Rewrite the `crescendo` function to work on any parameter, e.g. to shape velocity, filters, â€¦
- [ ] Rethink how patterns are defined (to make it more readable)
